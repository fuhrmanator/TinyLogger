# User documentation of TinyLogger

`TinyLogger` is a logger implementation (no kidding?!) for Pharo whose goal is to be small and simple.

Users can configure the way the logger works and the image will use this configured logger as default to record information. 

For specific cases, a specialized logger can be used.

## Quick start

Here's an example to create a logger using a file `Progress.log`:

```Smalltalk
TinyLogger default removeFileLoggers; "remove any existing file loggers"
    addFileLoggerNamed: 'Progress.log'.
```

Then write a message to the log using `record`:

```Smalltalk
'Uh oh. Something happened.' record
```

## Configure your logger

The first step to use `TinyLogger` will be to configure the default logger that will be used by the image. 

For most of the cases, the user will only interact with `TinyLogger` class. `TinyLogger` is a composite to which *leaf* loggers can be added. *Leaf* loggers have the responsibility to log information in a specific manner. For example `TinyLogger` has a *leaf* logger to print information on Stdout of the application.

### Add sub-loggers to your `TinyLogger`

The default instance of `TinyLogger` has no logger registered when it is initialized. The first step will be to add one or many loggers to it. 

Here is the list of loggers available by default:
* `TinyStdoutLogger`: This logger records information on the *stdout* of the application.
* `TinyTranscriptLogger`: This logger records information on the Pharo's `Transcript`.
* `TinyFileLogger`: This logger records information in a file on the user file system. By default the file will be named `TinyLogger.log` and located in the image directory, but the file can be customized.

A *leaf* logger can be added to the default logger via the method `addLogger:` like this:

```Smalltalk
	TinyLogger default addLogger: TinyStdoutLogger new
```

But all default *leaf* loggers have a method to create a new instance and the new instance to the `TinyLogger` already present.

Here is an example adding a stdout logger, a transcript logger, a file logger with the default file name and a file logger with a customized name to the default `TinyLogger` instance:

```Smalltalk
TinyLogger default
	addStdoutLogger;
	addTranscriptLogger;
	addFileLogger;
	addFileLoggerNamed: '../logs/MyOtherLog.log'.
```

### Remove sub-loggers

If at some point you wants to remove one or multiple loggers, `TinyLogger` has some API elements to do that. 

The first way to remove loggers is with the method `removeAllLoggers`, which removes all the loggers of each kind.

```Smalltalk
TinyLogger default removeAllLoggers
```

A second way to remove loggers is to remove them by kind:
* `removeFileLoggers`
* `removeTranscriptLoggers`
* `removeStdoutLoggers`

```Smalltalk
TinyLogger default removeFileLoggers
```

A last way is to use the method `removeLogger:` with the logger to remove.

```Smalltalk
TinyLogger default fileLoggers
	select: [ :logger | logger fileName beginsWith: 'Test' ]
	thenDo: [ :logger | TinyLogger default removeLogger: logger ]
```

### List the sub-loggers

If you wish to get the list of loggers in a `TinyLogger` you can use the `loggers` method:

```Smalltalk
TinyLogger default loggers
```

You can also get it in the form of a dictionary with the kind of logger as keys and the instanciated loggers of this kind as values via the `loggersMap` method.

```Smalltalk
TinyLogger default loggersMap
```

If you with to know all the loggers of a kind, you can use:
* `fileLoggers`
* `transcriptLoggers`
* `stdoutLoggers`

### Configure the timestamp format

By default, the preamble of the log will be a timestamp with a human readable format, e.g.: 

```
2018-11-29T23:19:55.511775+01:00 : Test
```

But this format is configurable. The `timestampFormatBlock:` method can be used with a parameter that is a block taking a stream as parameter and the timestamp (instance of `DateAndTime`) and use that to write the preamble on the stream.

```Smalltalk
TinyLogger default
		timestampFormatBlock: [ :aStream :timestamp | 
			timestamp asDate printOn: aStream.
			aStream << ' '.	"Cannot use #space because of Stdio streams"
			timestamp asTime print24: true on: aStream ]
```

This will produce logs of this format:

```
29 November 2018 00:06:30 : Test
```

## Record with your logger

This section will cover the API to record information. 

### Record a single line log

To record a single line on a log, you can just use the method `record`:

```Smalltalk
'This is a string to log' record
```

This will produce a log like this with the default `timestampFormatBlock`:

```
2018-11-29T23:19:55.511775+01:00 : This is a string to log
```

### Recording the execution of a task

To record the execution of a task you can use the method `execute:recordedAs:`

```Smalltalk
self execute: [ 1 to: 5 do: [ :value | value asString record ] ] recordedAs: 'Task with only one nesting.'
```

Will produce a log like this:

```
2018-11-29T23:21:04.897775+01:00 : 	Begin: Task with only one nesting.
2018-11-29T23:21:04.900775+01:00 : 		1
2018-11-29T23:21:04.902775+01:00 : 		2
2018-11-29T23:21:04.904775+01:00 : 		3
2018-11-29T23:21:04.906775+01:00 : 		4
2018-11-29T23:21:04.908775+01:00 : 		5
2018-11-29T23:21:04.909775+01:00 : 	End: Task with only one nesting.
```

It is also possible to nest them:

```Smalltalk
self execute: [ 
	1 to: 4 do: [ :value1 | 
		self execute: [
			1 to: value1 do: [ :value2 | value2 asString record ]
			] recordedAs: 'My second nest'
		 ]
	 ] recordedAs: 'My first nest'.
```

It will produce this kind of output:

```
2018-11-29T23:21:20.147775+01:00 : 	Begin: My first nest
2018-11-29T23:21:20.151775+01:00 : 			Begin: My second nest
2018-11-29T23:21:20.153775+01:00 : 				1
2018-11-29T23:21:20.155775+01:00 : 			End: My second nest
2018-11-29T23:21:20.157775+01:00 : 			Begin: My second nest
2018-11-29T23:21:20.158775+01:00 : 				1
2018-11-29T23:21:20.160775+01:00 : 				2
2018-11-29T23:21:20.161775+01:00 : 			End: My second nest
2018-11-29T23:21:20.163775+01:00 : 			Begin: My second nest
2018-11-29T23:21:20.164775+01:00 : 				1
2018-11-29T23:21:20.165775+01:00 : 				2
2018-11-29T23:21:20.167775+01:00 : 				3
2018-11-29T23:21:20.169775+01:00 : 			End: My second nest
2018-11-29T23:21:20.171775+01:00 : 			Begin: My second nest
2018-11-29T23:21:20.172775+01:00 : 				1
2018-11-29T23:21:20.175775+01:00 : 				2
2018-11-29T23:21:20.176775+01:00 : 				3
2018-11-29T23:21:20.177775+01:00 : 				4
2018-11-29T23:21:20.179775+01:00 : 			End: My second nest
2018-11-29T23:21:20.180775+01:00 : 	End: My first nest
```

## Use a logger other than the global logger

In some cases we may not want to use the default logger for a part of the application.

`TinyLogger` allows using a custom logger during the execution of a process by changing the value of `TinyCurrentLogger`:

```Smalltalk
| customLogger |
customLogger := TinyLogger new
	addTranscriptLogger;
	yourself.
	
TinyCurrentLogger value: customLogger during: [
	'test' record.
	TinyCurrentLogger value record: 'Test2'
]
```
